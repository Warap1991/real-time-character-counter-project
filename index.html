            <p>Using the Real-Time Character Counter

                Getting started with our Real-Time Character Counter is a breeze:
                <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Input Your Text:</b> In the text input area, simply start typing or paste your text.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>Real-Time Counting:</b> Watch the character count update in real-time as you type or make changes.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>Set Character Limit (Optional):</b> If you have a specific character limit to adhere to, you can set it. The counter will alert you when you approach or exceed the limit.
                </li>   
                <li> 
                    <b>Clear and Reset:</b> Use the "Clear" button to remove all text from the input area, or the "Reset" button to clear the input while keeping your character limit intact.
                </li>
